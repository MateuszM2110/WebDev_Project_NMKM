Dear Lucas snow,

I hope you're well and feeling good regarding the progress on our website. I wanted to provide an update on the accessibility improvements requested for your website. Below are the key features we’ve added to ensure a much more inclusive and accessible experience for users with visual impairements:

Alt Text for Images: We’ve added descriptive alt text to all images across the site. This helps visually impaired users using screen readers to better understand the content being presented, ensuring they don’t miss out on important information.

Keyboard Navigation: The website is now fully navigable using a keyboard. This is essential for users with mobility impairments who may rely on keyboard-only navigation. We’ve implemented logical tabbing sequences and provided visual focus indicators to enhance usability.

Contrast and Text Resizing Options: We’ve optimized the contrast between text and background colors to ensure readability for users with visual impairments. Additionally, we’ve included options for users to increase or decrease text size, making the content more adaptable to different viewing preferences.

If you have any further feedback or would like to discuss these updates, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
