Dear Lucas snow,

I hope you're well and feeling good regarding the progress on our website. 
I wanted to provide an update on the accessibility improvements requested for your website. 
Below are the key features we’ve added to ensure a much more inclusive and accessible experience for users with visual impairements:

Alt Text for Images: We’ve added descriptive alt text to all images across your website. 
This helps visually impaired users to understand the content being presented, ensuring they don’t miss out on important information.

Proper Headings: We added proper heading tags in order to structure content clearly. This is a significat improvement as it helps screen
readers understand the page layout. This is also an aesthetic upgrade for all users who may visit the website.

Link Descriptions: We have ensured that all links are descriptive so that screen
readers know where all the links lead.

If you have any further feedback or would like to discuss these new changes, feel free to contact us.

Kind regards,
[Mateusz and Nikita]
