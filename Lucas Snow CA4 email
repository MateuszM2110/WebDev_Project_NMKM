Dear Lucas Snow,

I hope you're Happy with the progress on your website! Thank you for your feedback and the suggestions you've shared.

We ran the Lighthouse tool to assess the website’s accessibility....... 

Regarding the new page, We added a trips page that highlights the trips you offer and everything your customers need to know,
and we also showcased how skilled blind skateboarders can be. 
We agree that it is a unique perspective that can help raise awareness worldwide.

Lastly, We have ensured that the website layout is fully responsive on mobile devices so that mobile users will have a smooth experience navigating the site. 
We did this by ensuring proper image scaling on mobile devices, making the navigation menu more responsive, added beter readibility etc.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you'd like to discuss or any other changes you'd like to make.

Best regards,
