Subject: Website Accessibility and Updates

Dear Lucas Snow,

I hope you're doing well! Thank you for your feedback and the suggestions you've shared.

We can absolutely use the Lighthouse tool to assess the website’s accessibility. I will run the tests and provide a report on the areas we can improve.

Regarding the new page, I think it's a great idea! We can certainly add one that highlights the trips you offer, and we can also showcase how skilled blind skateboarders can be. It’s a unique perspective that could help raise awareness.

Lastly, I will ensure the website layout is fully responsive so that users on mobile devices will have a smooth experience navigating the site.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you'd like to discuss or any other changes you'd like to make.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Position/Role]
